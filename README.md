# Generate Password
- This program will generate a random password after getting the input form user
To make this possible I used a combination of HTML CSS and JAVASCRIP language. 
HTML and CSS were the back supporter language for the layout and JAVASCIPT made the logic possible.
- First step was creatin a series of arrays containing **numbers**, **uppercase letters**, **lowercase letters** and **different symbols**. It is important so the password can be at a high security.
- Next step was to create variables that will store the arrays and when we call them into the loop they will list the elements. 
- The most important element of the code is the **for loop** tha will make possible for the program to run and make random choices according to the length the user selects.
To make the user interactive I used **promt** element to ask the number of characters which wll determine the length of the password and the number of loop because we need a different character for every loop. 
The next questions just needed to be confirm or canceled  using **confirm** element asking the user for their preferenc on special character, lowercase and uppercase.
- Once all the logic and alerts are set up we call the main function to set it all in motion.
